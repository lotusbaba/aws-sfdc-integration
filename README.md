# aws-sfdc-integration

PFA the details below.

Repo -- https://github.com/lotusbaba/aws-sfdc-integration
App -- https://lf654zvknyitdw4i6pgsagkvt40jegmr.lambda-url.us-west-1.on.aws/

The app will add a new case to my SFDC account and 302 redirect the user to the S3 bucket where all the cases are present.

So every time you open the app the case in the S3 bucket object will contain new cases -- https://coinbase-bucket-west.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/coinbase-quiz-result

Let me know if you have any questions.
